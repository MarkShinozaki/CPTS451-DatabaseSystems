# Assignments

### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Assignments/Assignment%201) 

- Assignment 1 requires students to apply their understanding of ER modeling to design a database schema that accurately represents a complex business scenario. The main focus is on creating a detailed and correct ER diagram, understanding the implications of business rules on database design, and ensuring the final output is clear and follows the standards taught in the course.


### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Assignments/Assignment%202)

- Assignment 2 requires students to demonstrate their understanding of translating an ER model into a relational schema and writing SQL DDL statements to implement that schema. The assignment also tests the students' ability to handle and reason about the implications of foreign key constraints during typical database operations.

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Assignments/Assignment%203)

- Assignment 3 tests your ability to translate real-world database queries into relational algebra expressions, a foundational concept in database theory. It emphasizes the understanding of relational operations and their application to complex queries involving multiple tables and conditions. The rubric places a strong emphasis on correctness and clarity, ensuring that the relational algebra expressions accurately represent the intended queries.

### [Assignment 4](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Assignments/Assignment%204)

- Assignment 4 is designed to test your SQL query-writing skills in a variety of scenarios, emphasizing accuracy and the ability to handle complex queries involving multiple tables and conditions. The assignment is comprehensive and requires a good understanding of SQL and the relational database schema provided. The rubric focuses primarily on the correctness and precision of your SQL queries, with implicit consideration of query efficiency.

### [Assignment 5](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Assignments/Assignment%205)

- Assignment 5 is designed to test your understanding of database normalization and the practical application of relational design theory. The assignment emphasizes identifying and managing functional dependencies, normalizing database schemas to BCNF, and ensuring that the decomposition process maintains the integrity and efficiency of the database design. This exercise is crucial for learning how to create robust and optimized database systems.

### [Assignment 6](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Assignments/Assignment%206)

- Assignment 6 requires you to demonstrate your understanding of indexing in databases, including the selection of appropriate indexes based on query patterns, and to perform cost analysis for different search operations. The assignment emphasizes the importance of indexing in query optimization and the trade-offs involved in maintaining indexes. The extra credit question further tests your ability to calculate and compare the efficiency of various indexing strategies in terms of disk I/O operations.
