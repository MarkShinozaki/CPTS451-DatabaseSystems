# Project Description

## [Project Description Overview](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS451-DatabaseSystems/tree/Project/Project%20Description)

- The project for CptS 451 involves developing a data search application for Yelp.com's business review data, with a focus on database infrastructure. The main objectives include:

1. **Database Modeling and Design**: You'll model and design a database schema that accurately represents the Yelp dataset.
   
2. **Populating the Database**: You'll populate the database with large datasets, including data from Yelp and U.S. Census zipcode data.
   
3. **Querying Large Databases**: You'll perform queries to extract useful information from these large datasets.
   
4. **Optimizing Query Performance**: You'll use indexes to optimize the performance of these queries.
   
5. **JSON Parsing**: You'll work with JSON data, extracting necessary information for the application.
    
6. **Database Application Development**: You'll develop a standalone Python application that users can interact with to gather business information.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Milestone 0 (No Submission Required)**:

    - Download and install PostgreSQL Database Server.

2. **Milestone 1**:

    - **Parse JSON Data**: Download and understand the Yelp dataset, write code to parse JSON data, and extract necessary information.

    - **Design a Database Schema**: Create an ER diagram for the database, and translate the ER model into relational tables with SQL DDL statements.

    - **Build a Simple Database Application**: Set up a PostgreSQL database, import sample data, and write a simple Python application to query the database.

3. **Milestone 2**:

    - **Revise Database Schema**: Update your ER diagram and relational schema.

    - **Populate Database**: Insert data into your database tables and write triggers and assertions to ensure data integrity.

    - **Write a Metrics Paper**: Describe the metrics for classifying businesses as popular or successful.

    - **Build an Alpha-Prototype**: Develop an early version of your application with basic functionality.

4. **Milestone 3**:

    - **Complete the Application**: Implement the full application based on the detailed requirements in Appendix A.

    - **Demo Video**: Record and submit a video showcasing the application's features.

### Application Functionality:

- The application allows users to search for businesses in a specific location, filter by category, and analyze businesses to determine their popularity and success. The application retrieves all data from the database, ensuring that no internal data structures are used for storage.
